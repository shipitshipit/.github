# Ship it!  Ship it!

This organization is intended to host some CI/CD or CI/CD/CT utilities to help PEs, SREs, DevOps
-minded people engaged in DevOps or MLOps to ship faster.  I could do this work as part of my
personal account, but I feel this organization represents more of a "Neutral Zone" from which even
I could eventually be removed if it moves on.

It also acts as a logistical unit on which I've got some self-hosted runners.

# Image

With great reverence, I've used an image of the Blue Marlin pulled off Reddit without obvious
encumbrance or license.  What better shipping ship than the MV Blue Marlin Shipping some Shipping
ships, or carrying an entire platform (oil, not service, but OK) to where it needs to be deployed?
And who's gonna stop it?

SHIP IT !

# Charter?

No real charter, but I hope we can look at PRs quickly from a mindset of:
1. Does it hurt the project?
1. Do I understand, or do I need to Zoom/Chat to learn more?
1. Can I justify holding it back?

Let's ship Shipping Tool improvements faster.

Obviously, the silly things like formatting and whatnot should be resolved by opinionated
formatters: adopt the pre-commit triggers, and roll faster.
